              I guess the first step was that I found myself in a rut. The job I had as a graphic designer wasn't fulfilling me. I'd been seduced by the whims of Western Society, wanting a mortgage and money. I woke up on my 25th birthday and decided things weren't going to change themselves, so I needed to make a change.
            </p>

            <p>
              I still had a mortgage to pay and had to work, but I wanted to pursue new avenues â€“ then along came the skateboard. I loved snowboarding, but being in Wales there's not much snow, so I got myself a skateboard to relive the feeling of snowboarding.
            </p>

            <p>

              I quit my job and decided to go skateboarding. I went from John o' Groats to Land's End as a warm up before skating from Perth to Brisbane, which was the longest skateboard journey ever! After that I got my first book deal and here I am now.
